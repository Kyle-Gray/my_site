        <p>I'm very excited about this full stack immersive at Galvanize because this is my chance to get into the technology sector. I have always enjoyed all aspects of technology and I can not wait to create my own websites, games, and apps.</p>
        
        <p>At some point in my career I think my strengths would be best used in a small or start up company. That being said I just want to get my feet wet before I jump head first into anything.</p>
        
        <p>My hopes and dreams are very simple. I like the outdoors and one day I would like my own cabin up in the mountains. Other than that I would like to continue to travel, see new things, and meet new people.</p>
