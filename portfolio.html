                 <p>For my final project I got to work with Advanced Healthcare a small chiropractor in Fort Collins, Colorado. Their main priorities are to add an online scheduler to help streamline scheduling customers appointments and an online shop.</p>
                 <p>Working with Advanced Healthcare taught me how to better work with non-IT customers, cater to my partners needs, and of course programming. As it pertains to programming I learned about connecting the Google Calendar API with an active business. I found out that even though I could make an intricate interactive scheduler online, making something and getting people to use it is two entirely different things. When I brought my initial ideas to Doctor Irwin he was impressed with the power of computers, but he was skeptical about his employees learning and correctly using the technology. Doctor Irwin , without even knowing it, showed me there has to be a balance between how intricate the software is and its simplicity of use.</p>
